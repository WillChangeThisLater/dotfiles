## Important Packages

- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for installing required packages lazily
- [cmp-setup](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp) for autocomplete
- [mason](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim) and [mason-lsp](https://github.com/williamboman/mason-lspconfig.nvim) for managing LSP setup and config
- [onedark](https://github.com/navarasu/onedark.nvim) for theme
- [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) for the status line
- [telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for list selection (like `fzf` for but for neovim)
- [treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for providing commands over an AST. This is a weird but powerful one. Looks like I can do something like 'yac' to yank a class definition, 'yaf' to yank a function, etc. Probably worth doing a deeper dive into what this offers at some point

## Support Packages
- [indent-blankline](https://github.com/lukas-reineke/indent-blankline.nvim) for adding indentation line guides
- [plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) coroutine library. this is relied on indirectly by a ton of packages (including telescope)
- [which-key](https://github.com/folke/which-key.nvim) for showing keybindings
